# EZWait 

**Welcome to our System!**

We are EZWait. 
Our project deals with appointment management in an easy, fast and accessible way for all types of users - small and large private business clinics.
We will use one database that will contain all customer data and each user defines the restrictions and characteristics of the queue, the entire system will be managed in one place and this will make it easier for the business to manage several platforms at the same time.
The appointments for the manager will be displayed as a calendar where all the details of the existing appointments are displayed.
The customer connects to the system, registers at the desired business, sets a date and the characteristics of the appointment and receives a notification that an appointment has been made. each customer is shown the available appointments in the system so that each patient makes an appointment at a time and hours that are available and suitable for him and the business. any change in the appointment details, for example - changing the date or editing the appointment details, the customer will be notified by email and in the system.

3. [x] app.js  â€“ the entry point of the system
4. [x] Router â€“ consists of a map of all the API points for both server and client
5. [x] Controllers â€“ direct the functionality of the system6.

    - http calls logger - configured in the middleware directory, writes call logs inside logs folder, filename: http.log
    - error handler - consists of 3 parts:
      - express-async-errors package - wraps the controllers in try/catch statement automatically (no implementation needed), and calls the next(error) function in the catch block with the error thrown. the next function will "fall" into the errorHandler.
      - errorHandler - a function that is used at the end of the server that catches all the errors thrown in the controllers
      - Custom Errors - in the errors' directory. Classes that extends Error class, with status and message to pass to the error handier at the end. More can be added if we need them.
10.[x] models â€“ contain the schemas  that connects to the database through mongoose.

you can find all the tests under the folder "test".
 use [npm run test] to run all the test and check coverage and results.

`Management Account:`

The management possesses the capability to access a comprehensive overview of all users within the system, including their respective roles, activities, and relevant data. Additionally, they have visibility into the existing queues, encompassing information such as queue statuses, contents, and associated tasks. This authority extends to the capacity to implement modifications, adjustments, and prioritization of queues based on their discretion. In essence, the management holds the authority to exercise control over user-related aspects, as well as the configuration and prioritization of queues within the system, providing a versatile and adaptive approach to meet the project's specific needs and objectives.

`Customer Account:`

The customer can view all of their queues, including a comprehensive display of information such as queue status, content, and associated tasks. Additionally, they are authorized to edit and even cancel these queues as needed. These rights grant the customer full and operational control over their queues, providing them with the flexibility to tailor tasks and actions according to their specific needs and requirements. Thus, the customer can focus on managing their queue activities in a practical and personally customized manner based on project progress and evolving needs.
